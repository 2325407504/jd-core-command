jd-core-command (an extension of JD-Core from http://java.decompiler.free.fr/)
===============

This is my attempt to make a Java commandline version of the Java Decompiler JD as the author (Emmanuel Dupuy) does not wan't to do it himself. I found the sources of the eclipse plugin that Emmanuel made and constructed this project based on my findings. It does not work yet and I hope that any of you guys or girls that reads this are able to find out what I am missing.

The project is located in the src dir. In the org.src you will find the sources of the plugin that works for eclipse. If you are familiar with the eclipse plugin structure, this might be an even better place to look.

Have fun and let me know you any of you make it work
